Things to check while running code on gcp for any language
1. create dirs [align_data, corpus, lm, logs, working]
2. create 3 scripts in working [preprocess_data.py, align_data.sh, extract_translit_pairs.sh]
    - give absolute path of required dirs in each scripts (check once)
    - change the abrivation for language according to following list in preprocess_data.py file
    - change the abrivation for language according to following list in align_data.sh file
    - change the abrivation for language according to following list in extract_translit_pairs.sh file
3. create empty file "train.arpa.en" in lm dir
    - put 2, 5 spaces in file "train.arpa.en" and save (creating blank file)
4. before running the scripts start screen, log files and then run the following script
    - Python3 working/preprocess_data.py
    - bash working/align_data.sh
    - bash working/extract_translit_pairs.sh
